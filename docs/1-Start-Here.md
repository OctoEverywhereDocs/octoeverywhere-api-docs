# Welcome Dev ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the developer documentation for OctoEverywhere. OctoEverywhere's goal is to empower the maker community with the best cloud printing tools possible, and one part of that is empowering developers to make epic things!

OctoEverywhere has many different ways developers can use and extend OctoEverywhere's functionality.

- [ðŸ¤– AI Failure Detection API](AI-Failure-Detection-API.md)
  - OctoEverywhere provides industry-leading 3D printing AI failure detection with our state-of-the-art ML models. With our AI APIs, your printer, app, or service can harness the full power of OctoEverywhere's community-acclaimed 3D printing AI failure detection.
- [ðŸ“± App Connections](App-Connection-Overview.md)
  - Level up your app or service with remote access, AI failure detection, and more. Users set up the connection with an easy-to-use OAuth-style login, and your app is ready.
- [ðŸ”” Notification Webhooks](Notification-Web-Hook.md)
  - Real-time printer events are sent to any local LAN or internet-facing HTTP server. Including print completion, print progress, filament change required, Gadget warnings, errors, and more - complete with printer details and screenshots.

We thrive with our community and always want feedback. If you have any issues, ideas, or wish to discuss anything with us, [contact us via our support system.](https://octoeverywhere.com/support?source=dev_docs_get_started) ðŸ¥°
